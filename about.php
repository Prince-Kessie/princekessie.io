					<p>Brother Prince E. Kessie, the proprietor and developer of this "Trust the Process Business
						Website."
						He is the president and founder of the Christ Disciples Movement (CDM) youth organization in
						Kakata city, Margibi county, Liberia.
					<p>He is a alumnus of the Kakata Bible Training Center and a high school graduate from the Lango
						Lippaye Elementary, Junior and Senior High school located in Bassa community, kakata city,
						Margibi county, Liberia.</p>

					<p>Moreover, after Prince high school graduation, the Lord took him to Uganda to attend the Charis Bible
					College (CBC). Charis Bible College of Uganda is one of the 75 Bible Colleges of Andrew Wommack
					Ministries worldwide. He attended this Bible College for three years and earned a two years
					Diploma in Biblical Studies and a third year Leadership and Business Certificate from January
					2021 to November 2023.</p>
					<p>Most importantly, after his second year of mission trip in Uganda, he phenomenally had an
					unexplainable experience with the Lord Jesus Christ where He doubtlessly showed him
					 his calling. He told him He has called him to teach His Word to many nations 
					and He confirmed it with these three scriptures: (Ezra 7:10, Colossians 3:16, II Timothy 2:2).</p>
					

					<p>Technologically, Prince also earned certificates in Software Engineering, Microsoft Office, and
					Graphic Designing. So, by secular profession, he is a developer; he can develop your website and a
					database management system for your school, church, organization, business, etc.</p>

					<p><strong style="color: #fd5f00;">Static Website:</strong> Contents always the same on the internet
						and doesnâ€™t has a database
						management system with its admin dashboard. It is not interactive with customers as compare
						to dynamic website.</p>
					<p><strong style="color: #fd5f00;">Dynamic Website:</strong> Contents change at the convenience of
						its owner; and it has
						a database management system with its admin dashboard system which can be used to manage and
						monitor
						every activity in an organization, business, hospital, church, etc.
						It is very interactive because it gives customers room to do something on the website.<br>
